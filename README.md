# About Me 🕷️
Hi I'm Spider and I am trying to reskill. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing but learning is kind of its own reward, right? 😅
- 🔭 I’m currently working thru the [Full Stack Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about HTML & CSS
- 👯 I’m not looking to collaborate on anything yet, hopefully soon tho!
- 🤔 I’m not looking for help with anything right now.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/spiderfuture.bsky.social)
- 😄 Pronouns: it/they/any neopronouns
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to draw but I'm not very good at it.
